# Packs

A pack is a collection of controls and rules that allow you to continuously track your asset security and compliance while providing score and export functionality.&#x20;

### How do packs work?

* They can be exported as PDFs containing rule details, results, and suppressions.
* You can see the compliance score of your packs.
* Packs are compatible with resource groups, allowing you to see individual scores for each resource group.
* Professional and Enterprise users can create custom packs for custom needs.

### What do packs offer for Resmo users?

* Continuous and accelerated checks for security and compliance best practices

Rules are a method of analyzing your assets and are managed by Resmo. However, in some cases, rules may not be applicable to automate the whole process. Some controls require manual completion. For these kinds of controls, you can use the manual control type. Resmo provides manual control definitions in managed packs, allowing you to mark it as applicable or not depending on your system.&#x20;

Additionally, you can enter comments to manual controls, i.e., to add links, write reasons for being applicable or inapplicable, provide evidence, etc.

### How to create a custom pack

1. Log in to your Resmo account and go to the Packs page from the navbar.
2. Name your pack. Optionally, you can add a description and tags.
