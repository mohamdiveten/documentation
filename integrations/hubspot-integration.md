Resmo integrates with your Hubspot account to keep your asset landscape secure and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to Hubspot users?

* Aggregate a resource directory like users and teams from your Hubspot account
* Query your Hubspot users, teams, roles, and much more.
* Set up rule notifications based on Hubspot resource configurations.
* Continuously and automatically evaluate your resource compliance with security best practices

### How does the integration work?

Resmo has a Hubspot application that you can install once you sign up for a Resmo account. Our application uses API to make the initial polling and receive existing resources. Then, we receive resource changes and updates in real-time by regular polling.
