# Integrations Guide

Integrations help us collect your resource data so we can deliver unmatched insights and querying capabilities. In this guide, we share the fundamentals of integrations. We have a lot of them, so go to the specific integration page if you are looking for detailed information.

### Data Collection Methods

Under each integration page, we share which methods we use for which records. There are two ways we collect resources.

#### Using API

By default, integrations use API for initial collection. Many integrations use APIs and poll them to collect resources and their changes.

#### Using Webhooks

Resmo uses webhooks if integration providers support them. Webhooks means the integration provider pushes the data to our endpoint automatically. This helps us receive changes in near real-time.
