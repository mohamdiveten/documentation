### Owner

Each account has one owner. An owner can:

* Transfer ownership to another user within the same account.&#x20;
* Change user roles

Contact us through chat to change ownership.

### Admin

An admin can:

* Add, update, delete integrations
* Invite users
* Change user roles (except Owner)
* Add, update, delete queries
* Add, update, delete rules and rule notifications
* Add, update, and delete resource groups

### User

Users have read-only access to everything and can query the collected data. They can save queries and delete their own queries.

They can't see other users, integrations and can't take any actions on them.
