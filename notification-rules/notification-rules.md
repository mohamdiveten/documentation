# Notification Rules

Notification rules are a set of rules that notify you based on custom criteria when there is a rule breach. Resmo sends out these notifications to your selected notification channels.&#x20;

Mind that you won't get notified of a regular rule breach; only notification rules send alerts so that you avoid alert fatigue.

### How notification rules work

Notification rules have four critical elements:&#x20;

**Tags:** Tags help you filter your rules. (Optional)

**Severities:** There are four levels of severity. Select the ones that require your attention in order to receive only the alerts that matter.

**Integrations:** A notification rule requires at least one integration to operate.

**Notification Channels:** Your rule notifications will be sent to the channels of your choice, including Slack, webhook, email, and Opsgenie.

### How to add a notification rule
